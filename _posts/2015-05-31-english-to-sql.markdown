The project was aimed at helping non IT professionals in switching from Excel to Structured Database.
- Used statistical machine translation tool to translate English queries to SQL queries for particular college database. 
- Results were not encouraging as I only managed to get 400 parallel translation.
- It did perform good for simple select, insert, update and delete quereies and some very simple join queries.
