This is a project undertaken by a me, [Michael Honke](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100008386298560) and [Dishant Mittal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dishant-mittal-7b9b40bb/)  as a course project for [Deep learning Fall 2017](https://uwaterloo.ca/data-analytics/teaching/deep-learning-2017) at University of Waterloo.
Photo-realistic style transfer is a technique which transfers colour from one
reference domain to another domain by using deep learning and optimization
techniques. Here, we present a technique which we use to transfer style and
colour from a reference image to a video. We take help from 2 different papers.

	1.Deep Photo Style Transfer Luan et al.
	2.Artistic style transfer for videos Ruder et al.


More Details will be available soon. Here are some of the examples:
