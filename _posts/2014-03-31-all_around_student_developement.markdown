The project was aimed at improving students to become an all rounder and engage them in different activities outside of their comfort zone.
- The software took into consideration various factors like academics, extra curricular activities , co - curricular activities. 
- The software predicted if a student was all rounder or not. I used a simple random forest to predict the outcome.
- It also provided simple recommendation for different events within my college to improve other parameters where the student is lagging.
- Here also I used the simple k-neigherest neighbour search to find the nearest all rounder person and try recommend him as a benchmark to improve.
