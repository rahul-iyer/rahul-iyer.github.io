The project was aimed at helping the manufactures to improve their products by getting aspect based sentiment from reviews.
- Used Recursive Neural Tensor Network with Word Vectors.
- Used StanfordCoreNLP toolkit and its dependency parsing framework to extract the aspects and sentiment associated with them by formulating rules.
- Also analyzed how reviews of the product fare over the time.
- Used a k-NN for recommending products to the user based on specific aspects.
